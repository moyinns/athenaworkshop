# athenaworkshop - adopt me!

My project is a game where you adopt a cat, then level it up through completing different tasks such as: giving it food, giving it water and petting it. Giving it food and water also replenshies your cat's hunger and thirst bars - if these get to 0%, then your cat dies and the game restarts.

I'm new to coding with godot and I wanted to make a game that is interactive but also aesthetic and this seemed like a good middle point. I also wanted a pet I could look after in the background while I'm revising or getting on with other tasks.

I first broke the main functions I wanted my project to have on a whiteboard. This included, feeding, naming, petting and leveling up the pet. I then broke this down into different scenes depending on each task and also ensured that all the functions I wanted to have in my project were actually feasible. I then moved onto Ibis-Paint-X where I designed the layout, text and theme of each scene using my Ipad, and some of the props (e.g. the food bowls), which I then sent over to my laptop. Then, I solely focused on coding the project.

I struggled A LOT with a specific error I kept getting while trying to upload (Abort runtime error). This was because of two reasons: the method I used for the save and load functions were incompatible with web and my music file for the background was too long. I spent many hours trying to debug it but through this, I did learn a lot about how Godot works. I also struggled at first with the coding aspect, as I'm used to python. However, now, I've learnt Godot is very similar to python, and I'm now a lot more comfortable coding with it.
